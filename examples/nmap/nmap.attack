Attack: nmap attacks for example.com
  Preparation:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the target hostname is "google.com"
    And the target tcp_ping_ports are "22,25,80,443"


  Tactic: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp   open  http
      443/tcp  open  https
      3128/tcp open  squid-http
      8080/tcp open  http-proxy
      """
  Tactic: Verify that there are no unexpected ports open
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      22/tcp
      25/tcp
      """

  Tactic: Using tcp syn ping scan and the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F -PS<tcp_ping_ports> <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp   open  http
      443/tcp  open  https
      3128/tcp open  squid-http
      8080/tcp open  http-proxy
      """

  Tactic: Output to XML
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 80,443 -oX foo.xml <hostname>
      """
    And the file "foo.xml" should contain XML:
      | css                                                          |
      | ports port[protocol="tcp"][portid="80"] state[state="open"]  |
      | ports port[protocol="tcp"][portid="443"] state[state="open"] |
    And the file "foo.xml" should not contain XML:
      | css                                                          |
